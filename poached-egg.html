        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>With simple and inexpensive ingredients that you could find in your fridge at this very moment you have no excuse not to make this.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>1 egg</li>
              <li>1/2 cup water</li>
              <li>Salt and pepper</li>
              <li>1 tomato optional</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>Add 1/2 cup of water to small microwavable bowl.</li>
              <li>Crack egg into bowl.</li>
              <li>Place bowl into microwave for about 60-80 seconds, depending on the power of your microwave. As long as the egg doesn't explode, it will be okay.</li>
              <li>Remove bowl from microwave, and use a spoon (not a fork, duh) to remove the egg from the bowl (water not included).</li>
              <li>At this point, you can be finishedâ€” just add a pinch of salt, pepper (and fajita seasoning) and enjoy! If you are feeling fancy, continue to the 
                  next steps.</li>
              <li>Take your favorite tomato, preferably a plump one, and cut it horizontally approximately 1/3 of the way down from the top. Scoop out the insides of 
                  the tomato to make it look like a bowl itself.</li>
              <li>Place egg in tomato, and voila! Bone apple tea! Your meal is complete, and now you can amaze your friends with your delicious looking egg entree.</li>
          </ol>
