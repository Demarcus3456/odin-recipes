        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>frittatas are perfect for anyone looking to stretch their ingredients and feed a crowd even if they might not be the strongest chef. The hardest part about 
             making this dish is waiting for it to cook in the oven.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
              <li>½ cup diced onions</li>
              <li>8 large eggs</li>
              <li>½ cup of milk</li>
              <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
              <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
          <ol>
              <li>Any 2-quart baking dish works well for this frittata. (For a classic look, bake your frittata in a cast-iron skillet.) Larger dimensions will work, 
                  too, but will yield shallower frittatas and require shorter cooking times.</li>
              <li>Beat the eggs only enough to blend the whites and yolks. Overbeating will cause the frittata to poof in the oven, then fall into a denser layer when
                   cooling.</li>
              <li>While just about anything can be stirred into the egg base, you should stick to ingredients that are already cooked. For anything with excess 
                  moisture, such as sautéed greens, be sure to squeeze out any liquid first.</li>
              <li>The frittata can be served immediately or warm. Once cooled to room temperature, it can stand for up to an hour. A cooled frittata can be 
                  refrigerated up to 1 day. Serve cold, bring to room temperature, or reheat before serving.</li>
          </ol>
